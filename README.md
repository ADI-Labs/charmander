# ADI Labs Website
This is the structure I coded for the ADI Labs Website. ADI Labs is a programming club in Columbia Univeristy to bring together students who just wanna build stuff! The Website includes some key features: 

1. A project suggestion tool (for Coumbia students to suggest and vote on projects they want ADI to make)
2. A project update tool, that lets developers easily update information about progress on their apps
